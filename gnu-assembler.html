  <h1>agbasm (GNU Assembler Modifications)</h1>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/luckytyphlosion/agbcc/tree/new_layout_with_libs">GitHub link</a></p>
  <p>In 2019, I added new features to a fork of GNU Assembler, a popular commercial assembler, which I deemed necessary for a source recreation of Mega Man Battle Network 6. The major features implemented are “true” local labels which go out of scope when a non-local label is defined, the ability to supply macro arguments across multiple lines, and the ability to define custom string encoding. The full list of new features can be found <a href="./agbasm_help.txt">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Modifying the assembler overall required a deep understanding in how C works and the ability to read other people’s code.</p>
