      <p className="about-page-body">Hi, my online handle is luckytyphlosion. I’m a programmer fluent in Python, Java, and C. I also am fluent in the Game Boy assembly language GBZ80. My programming projects usually revolve around making tools for the video game communities I’m in, whether the tools are for myself or for the community. Much of my projects have been related to reverse engineering the generation 1-3 series of Pokémon and Mega Man Battle Network, however in recent years I’ve started to branch out into web development to broaden my skills.</p>
