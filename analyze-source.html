  <p>During 2019, I was working on a source recreation of a Game Boy Advance game called Mega Man Battle Network 6, which was written in ARM7TDMI assembly. Part of that process involves documenting the extracted assembly. I created a program that would automatically replace the raw numbers associated with struct accesses with variable names. This ends up being a non-trivial task as in assembly, thereâ€™s no way to know the specific type of a register on its own; so instead context from the entire function has to be used. The program will do a static trace from a starting function, using inference rules to determine the type of a register each time it is modified with a new value. For example, reading from a specific part of memory into register r0, where that memory is marked as containing a BattleObject type would set a register r0 to a BattleObject type.</p>
  <p>The project overall required deep knowledge of core Python features and programming techniques such as string parsing and manipulation, regex, data structure manipulation, and object oriented programming.</p>
