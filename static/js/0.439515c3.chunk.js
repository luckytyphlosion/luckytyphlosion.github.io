This ends up being a non-trivial task as in assembly, there\u2019s no way to know the specific type of a register on its own; so instead context from the entire function has to be used. The program will do a static trace from a starting function, using inference rules to determine the type of a register each time it is modified with a new value. For example, reading from a specific part of memory into register r0, where that memory is marked as containing a BattleObject type would set a register r0 to a BattleObject type."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"The project overall required deep knowledge of core Python features and programming techniques such as string parsing and manipulation, regex, data structure manipulation, and object oriented programming."))}},31:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/analyze-source-demo.26660386.png"}}]);
