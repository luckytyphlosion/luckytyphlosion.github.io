I chose Electron as a way to learn how to use React, and for me to step out of my comfort zone in terms of programming.</p>\r\n      <p>I learned many concepts about Electron, React, and Typescript during development. I had to learn the basics of TypeScript’s type checking, such as typed arguments, but I also learned about generic interfaces, keyof, and the as keyword. I learned about how React manages state via the state field and setState method of a React.Component. I learned about how React handles event changes using custom element attributes to be supplied with callbacks. I learned about the fundamentals of Electron to the point that I could release a basic application. I learned about Electron’s process model of having two processes, the main and renderer process, and how to communicate between them securely without exposing the renderer process to node.js using a preload script. I learned how to build a node.js app for distribution, and then use those built files in an Electron app.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default AutoTTRecorderYTProj;\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/auto-tt-recorder-gui-window.2f65f3c6.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
