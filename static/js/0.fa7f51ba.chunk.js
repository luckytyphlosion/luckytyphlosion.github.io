I learned about how React handles event changes using custom element attributes to be supplied with callbacks. I learned about the fundamentals of Electron to the point that I could release a basic application. I learned about Electron\u2019s process model of having two processes, the main and renderer process, and how to communicate between them securely without exposing the renderer process to node.js using a preload script.
