  <p>Between 2021 and 2022, I created a command line tool called Auto-TT-Recorder to automatically record (as a video) single player races or “Time Trials” of Mario Kart Wii using the game’s built-in replay feature. The GitHub page can be found <a href="https://github.com/luckytyphlosion/auto-tt-recorder">here</a>. Python was used for the main program logic, a Wii emulator named <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/">Dolphin</a> was used to run the Mario Kart Wii ISO, and FFmpeg was used to encode the resulting video.</p>
  <p>The program has seen use on channels that upload Mario Kart Wii time trials, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxCPLtXIg43HRP6QZN8gyYQ">CTGP Records</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/200ccCTGPRecords">200cc CTGP Records</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CTGPKartRecords">CTGP Kart Records</a>.</p>
  <p>Various features were added into the program, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The ability to record ghosts from the <a href="https://chadsoft.co.uk/time-trials/">CTGP Revolution Ghost Database</a>, by supplying a link to the ghost from the Ghost Database website</li>
    <li>Automatic track downloading from <a href="https://ct.wiimm.de/">Wiimm’s custom track archive</a></li>
    <li>Simple editing options, such as the ability to show an in-game top 10 screen before the replay</li>
    <li>The ability to add custom music to the video</li>
    <li>The ability to add an input display overlay to the video showing the currently pressed controller inputs</li>
    <li>Video specific encoding options to control the video resolution, video and audio codecs used, and video and audio quality</li>
  </ul>
